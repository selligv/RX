# RX
reading RC receiver channels
I'm not a programmer, by any stretch
I'm attempting to create an RC servo receiver reader and/or repeater
I've a large problem finding resources for the Rapid Prototype TAU board
really, because I'm not knowlegeable, and the frontier for ZERO SAMD 
timers and interrupts is not yet readily available.
